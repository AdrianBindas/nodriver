# NODRIVER

## Features

## Welcome

**this package provides next level webscraping and browser automation
using a relatively simple interface.**

This is the official follow up on the [Undetected-Chromedriver](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver/) python package.

It stepped away from selenium/webdriver, which have had their best
time by now in terms of webscraping and browser automation.
Direct communication provides even better resistance against web applicatinon firewalls (WAFâ€™s), while
performance gets a massive boost.
This module is, contrary to undetected-chromedriver, fully asynchronous.

What makes this package different from other known packages,
is the optimization to stay undetected for most anti-bot solutions.

another focus point is usability and quick prototyping, so expect batteries included.
Using 1 or 2 lines, this is up and running, providing best practice config
by default.
